                I was involved in all aspects of Snyder's construction
                projects, from price estimation to closeout. I drew up

                I was working on ENGINEERING.com's online collaboration platform, ProjectBoard. 
                I designed and developed the new home page for the platform as well as the user 
                profile pages. I also improved the analytics dashboard, incorporating new data 
                visualizations that proved very useful for future business decisions.

                I worked on Grain Discovery's agricultural trading marketplace. 
                Introducing effective UI/UX was a challenge due to the wide demographics
                of users using the platform, from farmers to business traders. 
                However, introducing simplified user flows, and quick access to important 
                information proved to be effective in user testing. Outside of front end, 
                I also created RESTful endpoints to handle user interaction, as well as 
                incorporated Bash scripts to streamline developer pipelines.
